# PUMA-level Visualizations of Marriage and Family Formation Data Within 2023 ACS5 

This site shows maps and tables, at the PUMA* level, of two different metrics:

1. The % of adults ages 15-64 who are married.
2. The % of children who are being raised by a married mother and father. (Children who have one married parent at home and another living elsewhere, e.g. due to military service or work, are alse counted within this group.)

These visualizations were created as a means of checking the findings within our main [Marriage Deserts](https://ifstudies.github.io/marriage_deserts/) site. That site's visualizations use the 2020 Decennial Census rather than the 2023 ACS5; in addition, they show household-level rather than individual-level statistics. As a result, the two sets of maps do not match exactly; however, many similar patterns are present in both.

*PUMA is an abbreviation for *Public Use Microdata Area*.

## Categorical maps

These maps group regions into four different categories: *Deserts*, *Lower share* areas, *Higher share* areas, and *Highest-share* areas.

[% of children, by PUMA, in a married-couple family](maps/pct_married_family_puma_categorical_map.html)

## Grouped maps and tables

To create these visualizations, we grouped together contiguous regions in the same category, then determined which areas had the highest relevant populations (i.e. adults aged 15-64 in the case of the marriage maps and unmarried children in the case of the married-family maps).
