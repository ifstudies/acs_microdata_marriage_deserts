# PUMA-level Visualizations of Marriage and Family Formation Data Within 2023 ACS5 

[Note: PUMA is an abbreviation for *Public Use Microdata Area*.]

## Categorical maps

These maps group regions into four different categories: *Deserts*, *Lower share* areas, *Higher share* areas, and *Highest-share* areas.

[% of adults ages 15-64, by PUMA, who are married](maps/pct_married_puma_categorical_map.html)

[% of children, by PUMA, in a married-couple family](maps/pct_married_family_puma_categorical_map.html)

## Grouped maps and tables

To create these visualizations, we grouped together contiguous regions in the same category, then determined which areas had the highest relevant populations (i.e. adults aged 15-64 in the case of the marriage maps and unmarried children in the case of the married-family maps).

### Grouped married-family maps/tables

*(Note: the population values shown within these maps and tables represent the number of unmarried children rather than the total population.)*
